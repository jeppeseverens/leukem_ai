class DESeq2RatioNormalizer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """
    Transformer implementing the DESeq2 median-of-ratios normalization.

    This normalizer:
      1. Filters out lowly expressed genes based on a threshold.
      2. Computes gene-wise log counts.
      3. Normalizes raw count data using size factors derived from the median log ratio.
      4. Applies a log2 transformation (after adding a pseudocount of 1).

    Attributes
    ----------
    logmeans_ : np.ndarray
        Gene-wise mean log counts computed on filtered data.
    ok_expressed_genes_ : np.ndarray (bool)
        Boolean mask for genes that are sufficiently expressed.
    finite_genes_ : np.ndarray (bool)
        Boolean mask for genes with finite (non -âˆž) log means.

        Fit the normalizer by computing gene-wise log means on filtered data.

        Genes are filtered out if they do not have sufficient expression:
          - Must have non-negligible total reads.
          - Must have counts greater than 9 in at least half of the samples.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray
            Raw count data (rows are samples and columns are genes).
